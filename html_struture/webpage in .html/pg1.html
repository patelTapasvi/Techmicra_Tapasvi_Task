                    processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change
                    of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.</p>

                    Hallmark writers. Whether you read the whole guide or skip to your specific thank-you situation, we
                    hope
                    it adds to the feel-good factor of putting your thanks in writing.</td>
